# ðŸš€AI-Powered Physics Buddy Chatbot ðŸ“š

## Introduction

Welcome to the AI-Powered Physics Buddy Chatbot project! ðŸŒŸ this project create an awesome Physics Chatbot that will be a reliable companion and a best friend to all CBSE Class 11 Physics students. This chatbot will be powered by NLP (Natural Language Processing) magic, equipped with a vector store for efficient data retrieval, and deployed using Docker for easy packing and deployment. Let's get started! ðŸš€

## Key Steps Involved in the Project:


### 1. Web Scraping: 
I extracted content related to 11th-grade physics using the powerful BeautifulSoup4 library and structured the data in JSON format.

### 2. Natural Language Processing: 
To process the JSON data, I performed tokenization, lemmatization, and created a bag-of-words representation of the text using the mltk library. This preprocessing step was crucial for training the chatbot model.

### 3. Model Training: 
Using the processed data, I trained a deep learning model that employed pattern matching techniques. Keras library was used to build and train the model, which allowed the chatbot to identify patterns in user input and respond accordingly.

### 4. Flask Application: 
I developed a user-friendly web application using Flask. The application handles incoming queries, tokenizes and processes them, and utilizes the trained model to generate relevant responses.

### 5. Docker Containerization and Deployment: 
To ensure easy deployment and scalability, I containerized the application using Docker and deployed it on the Render platform. This setup allows the chatbot to be accessed via the provided link.

## Conclusion

With the AI-Powered Physics Buddy Chatbot, we aim to revolutionize the way students learn and interact with Physics concepts. By combining NLP, vector stores, and Docker deployment, we're creating an intelligent and efficient learning companion for CBSE Class 11 Physics students. Let's make education fun, interactive, and accessible to all! ðŸŒŒðŸ’¡ðŸ“š

Join us in this exciting mission, and together, let's empower students to explore the fascinating world of Physics with ease and enthusiasm! ðŸš€ðŸŽ“
